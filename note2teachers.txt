What's Up!
If you are reading this, you are either a curious student, or a teacher that actually decided to read this.
My name is Logan. As of writing this, I am a freshman. (May 30th, 2024)
This note is just here to say to ya:
This website is years of work. Although this iteration of it may be younger, some of the code is from my 7th grade year.
I have poured 100s of hours into this stupid project.
So, If you are a teacher reading this:
Please don't take down my stuff.
I understand if you want me to take down certain exploits, or a specific page.
Just contact me and I'll take down the offending pages.
But I will not be taking down the whole site, ever.

Respectfully,
    Logan J Kish
