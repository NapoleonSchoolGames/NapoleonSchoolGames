        <p>Below is my reason why, but ill put a TLDR here:</p>
        <p><strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This project was unprofitible, time wasting, and didnt benefit me</li>
                <li>I was only known for this when i can do better</li>
                <li>I will still offer paid services, so if you want me to make you a site, shoot me an email! kishloganj@my.jccmi.edu</li>
                <li>If you want to show support and see any future projects of mine, go to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dragonterror">Youtube!</a></li>
                <li>My discord and email is always open for questions (discord is "dragonterror"</li>
                <br>
                <h2>Below is the full story</h2>
                <p>Hey everyone! so this it it. I wanna say this was great. between making bookmarklets and this peice of shit website, ive learned a lot about html, css, js, and what dumbassary they can get you into. I really enjoyed working on this project and being the game supply for everyone. I am going to step away from the whole "bypasses and games in school!!!" thing. (mostly to focus on my studies) I also am stopping this because i dont want to just be known as the game supplier, if people know me i want them to actually know me.  This whole project was also unprofitable, and if i put my time towards something better i might actually be making money. This project meant a lot to me, and i will still do paid serviced (making your own site, or just giving you one game) if you would like that, shoot me an email! kishloganj@my.jccmi.edu You also may contact me on discord @dragonterror . If you have any other questions ask through my discord aswell. If you want to support me and my projects, (cuz yknow, i gave yall games for a year), go over to my youtube channel! youtube.com/@dragonterror </p>
